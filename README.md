# StreakNotify
- Forked from: https://github.com/YungRaj/StreakNotify

- This version is compatible with the new snapchat layout (like version 10.23+ or something)

- A jailbreak tweak that specifies to the user everything about Snapchat streaks and is an extension to tweaks that don’t take advantage of this feature of Snapchat. If you snap a lot of people, this is what you’ll want for sure.

- A clock/timer emoji and time remaining will show up on your feed for any streak that you have currently going with another user

- Notifications will be pushed based on intervals that you specify in settings

- Custom Friends allows notifications to be enabled for those specified in Friendmojilist settings
